#### Python Data Structures

Data Structures allow you to store and manage your data.
Organizing, managing and storing data is important as it enables easier access and efficient modifications.

Python has a number of **built-in** data structures:
- Strings
- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Tuples
- Sets

In addition to the built-in data structures, Python allows you to create your own data structures, enabling you to have full control over their functionality.

The most prominent data structures are:
- Stacks
- Queues
- Trees
- Linked Lists
